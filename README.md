# Code Your Future – Application Process

## About the project
This application has been developed to improve the existing application process of Code Your Future’s Coding Courses in order to make it:
		*for Applicants* - clear and exciting 
		*for Administrator* - structured and easy to manage
It aims to serve as an effective communication tool between potential students and Code Your Future. 

This application has been developed for mainly two types of users:

**Applicants/Students** – They will get the necessary info how to enrol to the course and go into a smooth step by step application process. This platform will allow users/applicants to manage and track the progress of their applications through the application steps. Applicants will be able to submit relevant materials at each step for Administrator to review. 

**Code Your Future Admission Team** – They will be able to provide potential students with the information, give them feedback in time after reviewing submitted links, so applicants can stay up to date and have a good understanding of their progress.
